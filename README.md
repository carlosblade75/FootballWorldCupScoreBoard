# The library is quite simple but I think I have added all the minimun methods to test it.
# The "repository folder" is to simulate the source where we get the name of the teams. In a real app, these should be in a external source like BBDD and not in the library.
# I put very few comments because as the library is simple and the code must be readable by itself. I think it can be understood without many commet lines.
